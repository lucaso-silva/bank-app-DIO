# Java Bank

This project is a basic baking system simulation built in **Java**, developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) challenge in the bootcamp "Riachuelo - First Steps with Java" from [Dio](https://www.dio.me/).

**Gradle** was used as the build tool.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply OOP principles: Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- Implement in-memory repositories to simulate persistence
- Use Lombok, Enums, and Records to improve code readability and maintainability

 ## Features
 - Create new accounts
 - Deposit money
 - Withdraw money
 - Transfer money between accounts
 - Create and manage investments

### Future Improvements
- Add unit test
